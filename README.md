# api-project - 1st project (Animal Crossing Fish Encyclopedia)
For this project I was told to build a Single Page Application (SPA). It wouls have to integrate everything I learned up to this point. The frontend had to be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and had to communicate with a public API. After looking through a bunch of them I found one for a video game i really enjoy. Animal Crossing! In the game you spend your time building a community with the resources around you. One of my favorite things to do in the game is fish. There are over 80 fish in the game and catching them all is a goal of mine. That being said, I thought it would be cool if by using the data given to me by the api, I ccould make a chart that displays all of the fishs' information (such as thier name, the time they can usually be found, thier selling price, and shadow size!).
